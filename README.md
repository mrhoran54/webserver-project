# webserver-project

This repository contains all the files needed for a basic webserver project in C that will do basic commands that include pulling up a file, displaying a jpeg image, displaying a gif, showing a histogram of all the different file types on your computer, and a python script that will pull info and display weather (note below). This project makes use of Pearl scripting, C programming, arduino programming, and basic HTMl protocol. 

There is also a component not shown here (the arduino code), where I progammed an arduino (a Blinky Board by Two Sigma) to display a digital image of the weather and the recorded temperature using information pulled from a weather api and loaded to the webserver with a python script.
